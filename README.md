# Concert App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

Have you ever wondered what songs an artist plays before you go see them in concert? This app helps you find their most played songs so you are not out of the loop.

Using the Setlist.fm Api I created a backend server 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run dev`

This is run in the server folder to start the server that will be doing the requests.
